# Ghostscanner5000
A ghostscanner Arduino project for Halloween 2016

Parts can be bought most places, mine came from all over the place.

I take no responisbility for the result of these instructions, anything that happens is on you. 

GhostScanner 5000
Consists of :

1 Arduino UNO R3 
1 HC-SR04 Ultrasound module
1 9V battery with plug for the Arduino board 

1 Custom LED board built on stripboard.
I use a 6 x 2 LED board, which uses up just about all current available.

You will also need some kind of shell for the scanner, I used a plastic jar where everything fits snugly. I sanded the outside and added some decals I printed to make it look more Awesome.

The HC-SR04 is plugged into digital pins 2 and 3, 2 for ECHO and 3 for TRIG. GND and VCC are connected to GND and 5V respectively on the Arduino. 

The LEDs are connected to digital out pins 4-9 and GND. 

Upload the Sketch and you are good to go.
